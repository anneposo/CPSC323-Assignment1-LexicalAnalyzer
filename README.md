# CPSC323-Assignment1-LexicalAnalyzer


The program generates a C source of a lexer that reads input from a file,
moves character by character to the next appropriate state in the FSM,
and matches the input with regular expressions to recognize tokens for each lexeme.

The identified tokens and their corresponding lexemes are written to a new file
called output.txt.
